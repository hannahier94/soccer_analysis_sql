# SQL / Python Project - Soccer Data

## Overview
This project will demonstrate the integration between SQL and Python code. 
We will analyze soccer data to determine various metrics. 

The motivation of this project is to gain more experience in SQL and review certain key concepts such as JOINS, AGGREGATIONS, and NESTED QUERIES. 


We will use pandas to operate SQL via Python libraries.
